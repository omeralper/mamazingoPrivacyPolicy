Mamazingo Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 13, 2025

Mamazingo is an AI-powered storytelling app developed by Omer Ozkan, based in Turkey. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

1. Information We Collect

We designed Mamazingo with children’s privacy in mind. We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or precise locations.

We only collect:

App Usage Data: Anonymous statistics to understand how the app is used (e.g., number of stories read).

In-App Purchase Data: Purchase details handled securely by Apple App Store and RevenueCat. We do not store payment details.

Technical Information: Basic device information (operating system, app version) to ensure functionality and improve performance.

Story Content: User-provided story inputs (such as favorite color, age group, or character traits) are processed to generate stories, but are not stored with identifying details.

2. How We Use Information

We use the collected information to:

Provide and improve the storytelling experience.

Enable in-app purchases.

Ensure technical stability and fix bugs.

Offer optional features such as AI-generated voice and illustrations.

3. Third-Party Services

Mamazingo uses trusted third-party services:

Apple App Store & RevenueCat for in-app purchases.

OpenAI / Microsoft Azure / Leonardo AI for AI-generated text, images, and voices. These services may process story content but do not receive identifying personal data.

Analytics tools (if enabled) to help improve the app.

Each third party has its own privacy policy.

4. Children’s Privacy

Mamazingo is designed for children and complies with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation for Kids).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Parents may contact us to review or request deletion of any stored information.

The app does not contain external links, advertisements, or social media integrations without parental oversight.

5. Data Security

We use industry-standard security measures to protect data. No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, but we strive to protect your information as much as possible.

6. Your Rights

Parents may request access to, correction of, or deletion of their child’s data.

You can contact us at any time for privacy concerns.
